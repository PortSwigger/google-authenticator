## A Burp Suite extension to apply the current Google Two-Tactor Authentication (`2FA`) code to relevant/selected requests.

This Burp Suite extension turns Burp into a `Google Authenticator` client. The current Google `Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)` code is automatically computed from a given shared secret and applied to bespoke location(s) in relevant requests in real-time.

Further information on two-factor authentication is available at the following links:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator>
- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226>
- <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>

Further information about Burp session handling rules is available at the following link:

## Graphic User Interface (`GUI`) overview

![example](images/configuration-1.png)

- Top panel: Secret shared key, used to generate the `Google 2FA` code using the `Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)` algorithm specified in `RFC4226` and `RFC6238`.
- Left panel: Regular expression for the session handling rule to match and replace with the current `Google 2FA` code.
- Right panel: `Google 2FA` generated code in real-time.

## Example

### Problem

We have been commissioned to perform a web application penetration test on www.foobar.com. This web application implements a login form incorporating `Google 2FA` for an additional layer of defence (prevents automated attacks such as brute forcing attacks). The client provided us with testing credentials along with a link to set up the Google Authenticator mobile application to allow for authenticated testing.

A login is performed using the following request (in this example, the `pin` `JSON` parameter is the `Google 2FA`).

```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: foobar.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/504482 Firefox/60.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://foobar.com/login
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 74
Connection: close

{"email":"ares@foobar.com","password":"SuperP@ssw0rd!","pin":"504482"}
```

Following the aforementioned link, we obtain the shared secret (`42TCJUDP94W27YR3`) that the `Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP)` uses to generate the `Google 2FA` codes.

During testing, we observed that the application is being protected by a `Web Application Firewall (WAF)`, logging our test user out each time a malicious payload is detected or if too many requests are sent in a short period of time. This configuration makes it virtually impossible to take advantage of the Burp Suite automated scan capabilities.

### Solution

1. Input relevant parameter(s) into the Google Authenticator interface:

   - Shared secret: `42TCJUDP94W27YR3`
   - Regular expression: `(?<![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])`

2. `Project options` -> `Sessions` -> `Session Handling Rules` -> `Add` a `Session Handling Rule` -> `Invoke a Burp extension` -> `Google Authenticator: 2FA code applied to selected parameter`.

   ![example](images/configuration-2.png)

3. Configure the relevant scope for the registered session handling rule.

4. Watch/monitor relevant request(s) getting updated with the valid/refreshed `Google 2FA` code generated by `Google Authenticator` using either `Project options` -> `Sessions` -> `Session Handling Rules` -> `Open session tracer` or the `Logger` tab.

## Tips

- Use the regex `(?<![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])` for optimal results as `Google 2FA` codes are made up of 6 to 8 digits according to the relevant RFCs.
- Restrict the scope of the session handling rule down to the request(s) containing the `Google 2FA` code only.

## Installation

### Compilation

1. Install and configure [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

2. Download this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aress31/googleauthenticator
   cd .\googleauthenticator\
   ```

3. Create the standalone `jar`:

   ```bash
   gradle fatJar
   ```

### Loading the extension into the `Burp Suite`

In `Burp Suite`, under the `Extender/Options` tab, click on the `Add` button and load the `googleauthenticator-all` jar file located in the `.\build\libs` folder.

Alternatively, you can now directly install/load this extension from the [BApp Store](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/fb3685f958f8424493945c6c60c0920c).

_Note: The version distributed on the `BApp Store` might be behind the version available on this repository._

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add additional features, maybe support for `Microsoft Authenticator`.
- [ ] Beautify the `GUI`.
- [ ] Implement a `JTable` to view modified requests in real-time.
- [ ] Leverage the `IHttpListener` interface and rework the filers in order to provide users with more ways of processing request(s).
- [ ] Source code optimisation.
