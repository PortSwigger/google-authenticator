<p>Google Authenticator transforms Burp Suite into a fully functional Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)
    client that automatically generates and applies current 2FA codes to HTTP requests in real-time. This extension is
    essential for testing applications protected by Google 2FA, enabling seamless automated scanning and manual testing
    without the need to constantly generate codes from a mobile authenticator app.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Real-time TOTP code generation using shared secrets from Google Authenticator setup</li>
    <li>Automatic 2FA code replacement in HTTP requests via configurable regular expressions</li>
    <li>Session handling rule integration for seamless workflow with Scanner, Intruder, and Repeater</li>
    <li>Live code display with 30-second refresh cycle matching standard TOTP timing</li>
    <li>Pattern matching support for flexible code placement in various request formats</li>
    <li>Session tracer integration for monitoring code replacements</li>
</ul>
