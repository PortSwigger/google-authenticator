<p>This Burp Suite extension turns Burp into a Google Authenticator client. The current Google Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) code is automatically computed from a given shared secret and applied to bespoke location(s) in relevant requests in real-time.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Input the <em>shared secret</em> used by the Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm into Google Authenticator.</li>
<li>Input the (regular) expression to match and replace in issued request(s) into Google Authenticator. Use the regex <em>(?&lt;![\w\d])\d{6,8}(?![\w\d])</em> for optimal results as Google 2FA codes are made up of 6 to 8 digits according to the relevant RFCs.</li>
<li>Configure a session handling rule that applies to relevant request(s) and invokes this extension.</li>
</ol>

<p>For more detailed instructions on how to use/leverage Google Auhtenticator, consult the README available on the <a href="https://github.com/aress31/googleauthenticator">GitHub project page</a>.</p>
